<p align="center">As I descended with the Dogs Blood Rising, so then I ascended to the Thunder Perfect Mind. Great grey bloodspeckled slabs of slate have fallen - this is my vision in the croaking jeering world: All idiotic faces and swollen hearts; in the papers the faces are not real, in the world the faces are not real - but in the Heart of the Hearts the Face is real. The dead die abroad, the crows fly, the wolves fly, and four poorly painted cardboard horsemen sheet over the back of the winds. 
They are not legion - but close.
